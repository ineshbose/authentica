## Study Title

**Exploring the Usability of a novel Online Public Key Signature System**

This is a research study focused on determining a measure for the usability of a novel online public key signature system. The study is concerned with several areas of Human-Centered Security, specifically online verification, and proof of signatures. You are being asked to take part in this study as a healthy volunteer.

## Contacts

The primary researchers are Anna Berry, Hector Jones, Inesh Bose, Marc Auf der Heyde and Stephen Connolly, 4th year students from the School of Computing Science of UofG. The study is being conducted under the supervision of Mohamed Khamis who is also from the School of Computing Science.

## Why is this study being done?

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of our novel online public key signature system, authentica. We want to compare the usability of authentica to similar existing solutions.

## What will happen if I take part in this research study?

If you agree, the following procedures will occur:

### During the experiment

You will be asked to complete the given tasks on your own time, without any additional help from the experimenter. While completing the tasks, you will be asked to think-aloud your thought process, which the experimenter will record in their experimental notes.

### Public Key Online Signature System Tasks (Overview)

You will be completing the experimental tasks in a controlled laboratory setting, likely on a Desktop or Laptop machine. The tasks will involve the use of a keyboard and mouse.

### Surveys

You will be asked to complete one or more surveys or questionnaires.

## What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?

Frustration may be experienced from the inability to complete certain tasks, or fatigue might be experienced due to the duration of the study.

## How long will I be in the study?

Approximately 1 hour in total.

## Can I stop being in the study?

Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Just tell the study researcher right away if you wish to stop being in the study.

## Are there benefits to taking part in the study?

It is important for you to understand that you will not directly benefit from this research. At the end of the experiments, we will explain what we expect to learn from the study. We hope that results from our research will be useful in the future development of usable online public key signature systems.

## What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?

You are free to choose not to participate in the study. If you decide not to take part in this study, there will be no penalty to you.

## Will information about me be kept private?
