# Task List

You will now begin to complete the tasks of our usability evaluation. As you are completing the tasks, please think-aloud so that the experimenter can take notes on your thought process as you are completing the task. Please provide as much insight to your thinking as possible. A good guide is to speak all the steps someone else would require to reenact your operation.

Example: "I am looking for the sign-up button, and have found it on the top right of the page. I will now click the sign-up button..."

Please do not proceed on this form until you have completed the below tasks:

1. The participant should create an account at authentica.
2. The participant should sign a dummy document with a filename of their choice.
3. The participant should view their previously signed documents.
4. The participant should find the available signature URL generated by signing the document. This can be shared with other individuals and the document to show a verified signature badge. Save this link to paste in the field below.
5. The participant should delete a previously signed document from their list.

If you understand the above tasks, open a new tab in the browser and navigate to <https://authentica-io.vercel.app/> to begin completing the tasks. Do not refresh the page after starting the tasks!

You can refer back to this tab if you have forgotten what the tasks are.
